# PyChef

Anyone can cooooook

## How it Works

Start by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next, run `jupyter lab` to launch the Jupyter Lab console.

Finally, open `pychef.ipynb` and run the cells!

## Adding more meals

There are four types of food objects

* meals - breakfast lunch and dinner options
* snacks - things to snack on, outside of meals
* baking - things you might want to bake
* essentials - things you need to always have in stock

You can edit the yaml files in `yaml_dir/` for the respective types to add even more options for PyChef to serve. Make sure the follow the template format 
at the top of each file.
