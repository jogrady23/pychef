# PyChef

Anyone can cooooook

## How it Works

There are four types of food objects

* meals - breakfast lunch and dinner options
* snacks - things to snack on, outside of meals
* baking - things you might want to bake
* essentials - things you need to always have in stock

Fill out the YAML objects for each of these, then run the pychef.ipynb notebook!
